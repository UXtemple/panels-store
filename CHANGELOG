# Change log

## [0.3.0] - 2015-06-12
### Changed

- Removed memoisation of panels, it will have to be thought out a bit more before it lands again.
- Removed blocks.
- Removed actions class. Export raw functions.
- Extracted stores functionality into raw functions too getting them ready to be stripped off their
  state soon.
- Replaced `immutable-js` for `seamless-immutable` as it is lighter and its output are cleaner and
  backwards compatible with vanilla JS types.
- Replaced the immutable record for a simple function that returns the values it specifically picked
  up from the object passed as an argument.

## [0.2.0] - 2015-06-07
### Added

- `getByUri` now uses `Lookup` to match dynamic routes in the store. Routes are matched by
  [Houkou](https://github.com/deoxxa/houkou) and a _complexity_ comparison is done to ensure that
  more specific routes are matched. There's lot of room for improvement here.
- `PanelRecord#from` and `BlockRecord#from` to load raw data structures and do any necessary
  mappings to immutables.

## [0.1.1] - 2015-05-24
### Added

- `title` field to `PanelRecord`.

## [0.1.0] - 2015-05-23
### Added

- Flummox Actions and Store.
- Immutable PanelRecord.
- Playground with dummy data and a flux app.
